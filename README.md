# To Do APP

My Second Portfolio Project, fully functional To Do App. build on MongoDB, PostgreSQL and DjangoBootstrap5


## Description

In this project, I utilized both MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases. The "Todo" database was constructed using MongoEngine, while PostgreSQL was used for the user database. Later, I connected these two databases together. For a more user-friendly and visually appealing experience, I designed the templates using Django-Bootstrap5. Currently, the project enables users to track their To-Do lists, mark them as completed, and keep track of their progress. Overall, this project showcases my ability to integrate multiple databases (not by traditional means since mongoDB is not officially supported by Django) and design a functional and visually pleasing web application.
